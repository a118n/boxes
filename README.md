Boxes is an asset management web application written primarily for managing printers, MFPs and their supplies. It may prove handy in large offices and corporations where you have to keep track of multitude of devices and supplies they use.

* Monthly usage reports for supplies that are delivered to your mailbox
* Monthly usage statistics for each individual supply
* Email notifications when supply is about to run out of stock (controlled by individual threshold)

#### Prerequisites

Install required packages:

```sudo apt-get install build-essential ruby ruby-dev git libmysqlclient-dev mariadb-server elasticsearch redis-server```

Install Bundler:

```sudo gem install bundler```

Install Node.js:

```curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -

```
MariaDB [(none)]>use mysql;
MariaDB [(mysql)]>update user set plugin=' ' where User='root';
MariaDB [(mysql)]>flush privileges;
MariaDB [(mysql)]>exit
```

Set up your root MySQL password as an environment variable:

```echo "export BOXES_DATABASE_PASSWORD='YourMySQLRootPassword'" | sudo tee -a /etc/profile```

Set up production secret key as an environment variable:

```echo "export SECRET_KEY_BASE='$(bundle exec rails secret)'" | sudo tee -a /etc/profile```

Load these variables into the shell:

```source /etc/profile```

Set up production database:

```RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails db:setup```

[This guide](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/install/nginx/install/oss/xenial/) describes installation of NGINX with Passenger.

[This guide](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/deploy/nginx/deploy/ruby/) describes application deployment.

Note: if you're having an error that says:

 `Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs for a list of available runtimes. (ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable)`

 Add ` env PATH;` on top of `/etc/nginx.conf`.

See [this issue](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs/issues/77).

#### Set up Sidekiq

Copy `vendor/sidekiq.service` to `/lib/systemd/system`

Edit `/lib/systemd/system/sidekiq.service` and make sure you define full path to the application in `WorkingDirectory` as well as your username and/or group in `User` and `Group` respectively.
